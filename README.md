[CS260 Lessons Learned](notes.md)

This file contains an organized breakdown of the lessons I learned related to Web Programming or the CS260 BYU course. This file may contain references to new files with additional information. Please reference these files as necessary.

Note: Not everything in this file will contain general programming information. Many of the notes may be specific to the "startup" project created in CS260.

Thank you.

### Elevator Pitch

Are you tired of sifting through Instagram pictures of cats, summer getaways, or whatever your friend had for lunch that day, eagerly looking for something to hook your attention? Let me introduce you to OutFishn, an angler's official social media replacement. Log your catches - show off that monster fish, get real-time alerts when a friend does the same, check the leaderboards, learn where to cast next, and much more! Create an account on OutFishn today and start reelin'.




> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.
